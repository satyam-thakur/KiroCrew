"""The FastAPI application: ``build_app(settings)``.

Responsibilities, and only these:

* Strip the crew route prefix (an ALB forward action cannot rewrite the path, so
  ``/c/<crew>/...`` arrives here) and classify on the STRIPPED path. Classifying
  the prefixed path made control routes read as customer routes in an earlier
  build, so classification is done once, after stripping.
* Keep the customer surface (a single turn endpoint) separate from the owner's
  control surface. The split is fail-closed: only ``GET /health`` and the turn
  endpoint are customer routes; everything else is control and requires the
  control secret. A customer cannot relabel a control route as a customer one,
  because classification runs on the stripped path, and cannot forge the control
  secret, which they do not hold.
* Register a bare ``/health`` in addition to the prefixed one, because the load
  balancer's target-group health check hits the container directly, with no
  prefix.
* Ensure the addressed conversation's transcript is on disk before the turn
  reaches the backend. Boot restores no transcripts (``EPHEMERAL-CONTRACT.md``),
  so this is where a returning customer's conversation comes back. The lock and
  the fetch are one scope (``transcript.prepared_turn``) built at a single site,
  so the streamed and non-streamed transports cannot drift apart on it.
