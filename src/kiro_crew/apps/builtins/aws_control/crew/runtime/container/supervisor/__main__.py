"""Container entrypoint: order the task, supervise it, drain it on shutdown.

Run as ``python -m container.supervisor``. This is the task's init process. It
does not serve anything itself; it enforces the startup order the contract makes
a correctness requirement and then supervises the three children.

The order (``container/CONTRACT.md``, "Startup order"):

1. ``run_restore(settings)`` runs to COMPLETION. Nothing else has started.
   Restore must finish before the backend starts: the backend's periodic flush
   writes its in-memory slot table, and a flush landing before restore finishes
   persists an empty ``open_slots.json`` and destroys the record of which
   conversations existed. If restore fails we abort *before* the backend starts,
   for the same reason -- a backend on an incompletely restored home will flush
   over the gap.
2. The backend starts and ``wait_until_ready`` returns (port answers AND the
   boot secret exists).
3. The front process and the sidecar start.

Shutdown drains process groups, not pids (see ``process.py``): a ``kiro-cli``
worker is a two-process tree and signalling only the launcher orphans a child
that finishes its turn. Teardown order is front, then backend, then sidecar:
stop new turns arriving first, let the backend drain in-flight work and flush to
disk, and terminate the sidecar last so it ran through the whole drain window
and had the latest on-disk state to copy.

Track boundaries: the seams for the other two tracks (``run_restore``,
``run_sidecar``, the front ``__main__``) are imported by their documented paths,
lazily, so this module stays importable and testable while S1/S2 are still being
written, and so it never reimplements their work.
