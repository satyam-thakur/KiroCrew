# smc-deploy.sh -- one command to stand a Share My Crew crew up in the owner's
# own AWS account.
#
# This is the Driver track. It is coded against deploy/CONTRACT.md and
# PACKAGING-CONTRACT.md, the seams between the parallel tracks. The crew now rides
# INSIDE the image (PACKAGING-CONTRACT): one artifact whose digest pins both the
# serving code and the crew content. There is no S3 bundle path any more -- two
# sources of truth for "which crew is this" is how the first design served a
# default agent while ten gates reported green. See the PORT NOTES at the bottom.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Resolves every value from `sts` and stack outputs rather than the command line,
#   CURATES the crew into a bundle (delegated to T1's `python -m packaging.build`),
#   deploys the base stack, builds+pushes a CREW IMAGE that bakes the bundle onto a
#   digest-pinned base (delegated to the crew-image track's
#   scripts/build_crew_image.sh), deploys the crew stack, republishes the API
#   Gateway stage, and then VERIFIES with gates that can fail -- including that the
#   running task definition serves the exact image the build reported, built from
#   the bundle that was curated.
#
# USAGE
#   ./smc-deploy.sh --profile smc --region us-west-2 --crew frontdesk
#   ./smc-deploy.sh --crew frontdesk --base <repo>@sha256:<hex>   # pin the base explicitly
#   ./smc-deploy.sh --dry-run --crew frontdesk        # exercise the whole flow, no AWS
#   ./smc-deploy.sh --from 8 --crew frontdesk          # resume at verify only
#
# The bundle is PRODUCED by step 1 (packaging.build), not supplied on the command
# line: there is no --bundle flag, because a bundle handed in alongside a curator
# is a second source of truth. The base image is pinned by --base, or resolved from
# the ECR repo's `smc-base-<ARCH>` tag when --base is absent.
#
# RESUMABLE: --from N skips ahead. Every correctness gate in step 8 runs from
# persisted/live state regardless of the resume point, so `--from 8` re-proves the
# deployment rather than trusting that steps 0-7 once passed.
#
# STEPS
#   0 preflight   1 bundle (packaging.build)   2 base stack   4 crew image
#   5 secrets     6 crew stack   7 republish stage   8 verify
#   (step 3, the old "upload bundle to S3", is deleted: the crew is in the image.)
#
# There is no public endpoint here and none may be added. Every caller
# authenticates with SigV4 against a private control API.
#
# MACHINE-READABLE PROGRESS: --events <path> writes one JSON object per line to
# <path> describing each step as it starts, finishes or fails. It is ADDITIVE --
# without the flag nothing is written and the output below is byte for byte what
# it was. --yes skips the step 0 confirmation for a non-interactive caller; the
# account is printed either way, because that is the last point before AWS
# resources are created. See the "event stream" block below for the schema.
#
# TESTABILITY: this file is sourceable. `set -euo pipefail` is applied inside
# smc_main, never at file scope, and the main flow only runs when the file is
# executed directly. Sourcing it (as deploy/tests/** does) defines the pure judge_*
# functions without running a deploy or flipping the caller's shell options.

# Machine-readable event stream -- opt-in, --events <path>. Safe to source.
#
# WHY A SECOND CHANNEL AT ALL. Everything above is written for a human reading a
# terminal. A wizard cannot drive a progress bar from it: the wording is free to
# change, so a UI that parsed it would turn every copy edit into a breaking
# change. That is the same trap CONTRACT.md already refuses for the image build's
# payload ("do not treat any stdout line as data"), so this channel is ADDITIVE
# and goes somewhere else entirely. With no --events every function here returns
# immediately and writes nothing, which is what keeps the prose byte-identical;
# run_gate_tests.sh proves it by running the same dry run with and without the
# flag and diffing stdout.
#
# WHY A FILE RATHER THAN STDOUT. A real deploy's stdout carries megabytes of
# docker and CloudFormation output, and the gateway-side runner redirects it to a
# log, so a reader tailing it for events would have to parse past all of that. A
# file is one writer, one line per event, and readable while the deploy runs.
#
# THE STEPS ARE 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8 AND THERE IS NO STEP 3. The numbers emitted are
# the driver's own -- the same ones --from N takes -- so "retry from step 5" in a
# UI and the flag it would pass mean the same thing. Renumbering to close the gap
# would break that identity, and the gap is documented, not accidental.
#
# SCHEMA. One JSON object per line, each with "v":1, "event" and "t" (epoch
# seconds, the same unit backend/progress.py records):
#   run     crew, region, steps[] (the whole ladder, up front), from, dryRun
#   account account -- emitted ONCE, when the account is first known, which is
#           before step 2 creates anything
#   step    step, name, state=start|ok|fail; on fail also reason and resumeFrom
#           (the --from N a retry should pass)
#   detail  step, level=ok|warn, text -- one per assertive line, which for step 8
#           is exactly the 12 gate verdicts
#   end     state=ok|fail|aborted, reason
#
# NOTHING FROM note() IS MIRRORED. Notes are commentary, and one of them -- step
# 5's api-key line -- is the closest this driver comes to a line about a
# credential (it prints a length and a 12-hex digest, never the value). Holding
# the line at "the machine channel carries nothing about a secret at all" is
# stronger than trusting that note to stay digest-only.

# no control secret (see judge_forged_secret_rejected), so a 200 on /health never
# indicated what this judge claimed. The deployed stack answered 200 and the message
# named a header the probe had not sent. Replaced by judge_health_through_control
# plus judge_control_refused_without_secret, which split the one assertion into the
# two properties that are really enforced.

# point 1/4, TRAP 6/8. What the control API's boundary ACTUALLY is.
#
# The first version of this gate required /health to answer 403 through the control
# API, on the theory that the API carries no customer routes. Nothing enforces that:
# the integration is {proxy+} onto the container's single port, so the API structurally
# carries every route the container serves, and the deployed stack answered 200. The
# assertion described an intention, not a mechanism, and the message it printed on
# failure claimed the request had carried the control secret when the probe sends none.
#
# The boundary that IS enforced, and worth gating, has two parts:
#   - IAM: nothing reaches this API without SigV4 from a principal in the account.
#   - The container: a control route is refused unless it carries the control secret.
# So /health answering 200 to the owner is expected. What must never happen is a
# control route answering without the secret.

    *)   printf '/health returned %s through the control api, expected 200.\n' "$1" >&2; return 2 ;;

# TRAP 8 + point 4. Injection probe polarity, per casing. The caller is ALREADY
# the owner (SigV4 authorised before any header was read), so:
#   200 = the gateway's mapped header value won  -> SAFE, required.
#   403 = the client's forged header reached the container and it rejected it -> FAIL.
#
# BOTH of those readings assumed API Gateway injects the real control secret and so
# overwrites whatever the client sent. The deployment deliberately does not do that:
# a static header value in the integration is readable with apigateway:GET (R3, trap
# #10), so the secret reaches the container through the secrets block instead and the
# gateway carries no copy of it. There is nothing to overwrite a forged header WITH.
#
# So the property to gate is the one the container implements: a forged control secret
# is REJECTED, in every casing, because header lookup is case-insensitive and a
# capitalisation that missed the comparison would be a real bypass. 403 is the pass.
#
# Kept as its own judge rather than folded into the refusal judge above so that a
# future gateway-injecting design changes one function, and so the log still names
# which casing failed.

# ===========================================================================
# PORT NOTES -- reported gaps where CONTRACT.md is silent (do not fix here; these
# belong to other tracks). The driver codes to the contract and states plainly
# what it had to assume.
#
#  1. Crew-image build interface. PACKAGING-CONTRACT (T2) + scripts/README.md. The
#     driver calls `build_crew_image.sh --base <repo>@sha256:<hex> --bundle <T1 out
#     dir> --repo <RepositoryUri base output> --crew <name> --arch <X86_64|ARM64>`,
#     reads the SMC_CREW_IMAGE_JSON=<path> marker line, and parses the
#     smc-crew-image/v1 JSON: image_uri -> ImageUri (must be @sha256, else nothing
#     pushed), architecture -> arch cross-check, bundle_digest -> continuity against
#     packaging.build's digest, crew_name -> must equal --crew. No stdout line is
#     treated as data. RepositoryUri is a base output the driver consumes but does
#     NOT pass to the crew stack. The bundle producer interface is T1's
#     `python -m packaging.build --crew <name> --out <dir> [--allow <path>]...`,
#     whose last line is SMC_BUNDLE_JSON=<path> naming {crew_name, bundle_dir,
#     digest, skill_count, mcp_servers, denied}.
#
#  2. ControlSecretValue. The source template took a plaintext ControlSecretValue
#     param (R3: a header mapping cannot dereference a secret). CONTRACT crew
#     params list ONLY ControlSecretArn. The driver passes only the ARN and assumes
#     crew.yaml resolves the header value with a CloudFormation dynamic reference
#     ({{resolve:secretsmanager:<arn>:SecretString}}). REPORT to Templates track:
#     confirm the integration gets its static header value that way, or add
#     ControlSecretValue back to the contract.
#
#  3. RulePriority. The source passed a RulePriority crew param for the ALB listener
#     rule. It is NOT in the CONTRACT crew params, so the driver does not pass it and
#     assumes the template derives a unique priority per crew. REPORT to Templates
#     track: confirm priority uniqueness across crews without a driver-supplied value.
#
#  4. StageName. CONTRACT has no StageName base output. The driver derives the stage
#     from the ControlBaseUrl invoke path and falls back to "prod" (--stage overrides).
#     REPORT to Templates track: consider adding a StageName base output.
#
#  5. Base parameters. CONTRACT lists base OUTPUTS but not base PARAMETERS. The driver
#     passes LogRetentionDays (the only retention parameter base.yaml declares; ruled
#     value $RETENTION, CHORUS R6). REPORT to Templates track: confirm that is the only
#     base parameter the driver must supply.
#
#  6. TaskCpu/TaskMemory have no CONTRACT defaults; the driver defaults 2048/4096 and
#     exposes --cpu/--memory. These are deployment sizing choices, not contract values.
#
#  7. kiro-cli presence is no longer gated by the driver. It was, reading
#     kiro_cli_present/kiro_cli_chat_present from the OLD smc-image-build/v1 record.
#     The crew rides in the image now and the driver reads smc-crew-image/v1, which
#     does NOT carry those fields -- the chat binary is a BASE-image property. So the
#     static gate is removed; the base builder (scripts/build_image.sh) verifies it,
#     and the real-turn gate catches its runtime symptom (a launcher-only image 502s
#     the first turn). REPORT to the crew-image / base tracks: if a static deploy-time
#     kiro-cli gate is still wanted, surface kiro_cli_present/kiro_cli_chat_present in
#     smc-crew-image/v1 (carried forward from the base build record) and this driver
#     will gate on it again.
#
#  8. deploy/CONTRACT.md is STALE and is held centrally (not owned by this track), so
#     it is reported, not fixed. Its "Crew parameters" list still names BundleObjectKey,
#     which PACKAGING-CONTRACT deletes and both crew.yaml and this driver have now
#     removed. check_param_seam.sh parses crew.yaml (not CONTRACT.md), so this does not
#     break the gate, but CONTRACT.md should be updated to match PACKAGING-CONTRACT.
