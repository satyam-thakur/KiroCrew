"""Hooks Integration — wires the hooks system into the gateway lifecycle.

This module provides the glue functions that connect:
- RouteRegistry into the enable/disable flow
- LifecycleDispatcher into gateway startup/shutdown
- CronSDK cleanup into disable/uninstall

These functions are called from routes.py and server.py at the appropriate
lifecycle points. An app that declares no hooks is a no-op.

    ``_drop_disabled_app_resources`` on a confirmed disable, whose docstring
    already records that it is "idempotent with the CLI's own deregistration" --
    that mechanism exists precisely because the CLI is out of process. It only
    ever visits apps with a spawned backend, so an app whose backend surface is
    ``hooks.routes`` alone is never swept by it.

    A hidden route is not a removed route, so this REMOVES the registration:
    ``on_app_disable`` pops the routing table entry, drops the AppContext,
    unloads the app's modules, clears its hook health and forgets its job SDK.
    The entry is gone, not filtered.

    ``run_app_hooks=False``, for the reason that flag exists: the app's
    ``on_shutdown`` is third-party code, and starting it as part of undoing a
    teardown the operator already performed would make the cleanup an execution
    vector. Everything the GATEWAY owns still runs -- nothing that STOPS
    something is skipped.

    Acts only on a CONFIRMED ``False``. ``app_enabled_state`` is tri-state and
    answers ``None`` when ``installed.json`` cannot be READ (EMFILE, EIO, a
    Windows AV lock); tearing down on that would take a live app's routes offline
    over a momentary fault, so an unreadable state leaves the registration
    standing and is retried on the next sweep. A MISSING metadata file is a
    definite ``False`` -- that is the uninstall case.

    Returns the app names torn down, for logging and for tests.
