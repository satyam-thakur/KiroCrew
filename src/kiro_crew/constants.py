# ── Canonical "[OPTIONS: a | b | c]" trailer parsers ────────────────────────
# The agent emits a trailing ``[OPTIONS: choice1 | choice2 | ...]`` marker that
# every surface renders as tappable choices. Two variants exist because the
# surfaces scan differently, but their GRAMMAR must stay identical — so both are
# defined here ONCE and imported everywhere: a hand-mirrored copy risks a
# one-character slip that flips the flag semantics or reintroduces the ReDoS
# class below on a single surface.
#
# Body: a TEMPERED greedy repetition that allows every bracket EXCEPT a ``[``
# that begins a fresh ``[OPTIONS:``. This matters for ReDoS (py/polynomial-redos):
# a plain greedy ``.*`` body can itself consume a ``[`` that also starts the outer
# ``[OPTIONS:`` literal, so over untrusted text with many ``[OPTIONS:`` prefixes
# ``search()``/``findall()`` re-explore the body from each position — polynomial
# backtracking. The tempered body is unambiguous (linear) while still capturing a
# literal ``]`` and any other inner ``[`` inside an option ("Fix [x] logging",
# "a[1]"). This parser runs over untrusted LLM/relayed text before Slack, the
# dashboard, Discord, Telegram, and WeCom render it.
#
# LINE (``re.MULTILINE``, ``$`` anchor) — for Slack/dashboard, where the marker
# ends a LINE (not necessarily the whole message). The negated class EXCLUDES
# ``\n`` (``[^[\n]``): in Python ``re`` a negated class matches ``\n`` regardless
# of DOTALL, so ``[^[]`` here would silently widen the single-line body to span
# lines (deleting/splitting a multi-line span the old single-line ``.*`` never
# matched). Trailing class is ``[ \t]`` (NOT ``\s``, which under MULTILINE would
# also match ``\n``).
#
# OPTIONAL MARKDOWN-LINK CLOSE ``(?:\(...\))?`` after the ``]``: models sometimes
# append a stray ``(OPTIONS)`` (or any ``(...)``) right after the marker, e.g.
# ``[OPTIONS: A | B | C](OPTIONS)``. That does TWO bad things at once: the extra
# text after ``]`` breaks the end anchor so the marker leaks unparsed, AND
# ``[label](url)`` is valid Markdown so the dashboard renders the whole thing as a
# clickable link instead of buttons. Absorbing a single tightly-attached ``(...)``
# here (it stays OUTSIDE the captured label group, so choices are unaffected)
# makes the parser resilient to that tic. The ``(`` must follow the ``]`` with no
# gap, so genuine trailing prose (``] and then...``) or a spaced note (``] (note)``)
# still fails the anchor and is left intact — the deliberate "trailing note on the
# same line" behaviour is preserved. The inner class is ``[^\s()]`` (NOT ``[^)\n]``)
# so it shares NO character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` — that keeps the added group
# unambiguous and avoids a polynomial-ReDoS (``py/polynomial-redos``) backtracking
# path over ``[OPTIONS:`` + a long whitespace run. The real tic (``(OPTIONS)``, a
# bare ``(url)``) contains no whitespace or nested parens, so nothing is lost.
#: Closing brackets accepted on a protocol marker. ASCII ``]`` is the only form
#: the prompt ever specifies, but a model intermittently substitutes a fullwidth
#: or CJK lookalike — U+3011 ``】`` is the observed one; U+FF3D ``］`` and U+3015
#: ``〕`` are the same class of slip. A single wrong codepoint otherwise breaks
#: the end anchor, so the whole marker leaks into the visible message as literal
#: text and the turn silently loses its follow-up pills. Label content is
#: unaffected either way, so accepting the lookalike costs nothing.
#:
#: ONE definition, shared by both regexes below. Deliberately NOT used by
#: :func:`split_trailing_protocol_suffix`'s unfinished-marker check, which stays
#: ASCII-only on purpose -- see the comment there. That asymmetry is the point:
#: completeness is decided by the trailer regex, not by whether some closer
#: character happens to appear in the tail.
#:
#: ReDoS profile is unchanged from the previous literal ``\]``. The class shares
#: no character with the trailing ``[ \t]*`` / ``\s*``, and the tempered body
#: already admitted ``]`` via ``[^[\n]``, so adding these three codepoints
#: introduces no new ambiguity.

# CONTROL-TAG HTML COMMENTS — canonical grammar (single source of truth).

# renderer skips). Three families exist in ``src/``:
#   * ``<!-- keep-visible -->``       — collapse-all exemption (#7948)
#   * ``<!-- deliver:<route> -->``    — heartbeat routing
#   * ``<!-- plan_task_id:<id> -->``  — task-planner Apply-to-Tasks anchor
#
# ONE GRAMMAR, TAIL-ANCHORED + FENCE-GUARDED, case-insensitive, both
# recognizers (this regex and ``website/src/app-sdk/protocol/
# keepVisibleMarker.ts``): only standalone tag lines at the message tail are
# control tags, and a tail inside an UNTERMINATED fence is visible code (see
# ``_in_open_fence``). Message-tail producers: the prompt rule ("as its
# final line") and the task-planner appender (newline-prefixed). The
# heartbeat's ``deliver:`` tags are HEARTBEAT.md FILE-format suffixes on
# checklist lines, not message-tail emissions — echoed into a message body
# they are mid-body content, which the dashboard renders as nothing and this
# strip deliberately leaves alone. Position-independent stripping was tried
# and retired: rounds 5–8 each surfaced another quoted-code dialect it
# corrupted.
#
# Tag-line leading indent is ≤3 (CommonMark: 4+ spaces renders as an
# indented code block — visible content, never a control tag).
# ReDoS note: every quantifier is BOUNDED (whitespace ≤16, tag body ≤256 —
# generous for real emissions like ``<!-- deliver:dashboard -->``), so a
# failed match attempt does constant work and total matching stays linear
# even on adversarial repetition input (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos: an
# UNBOUNDED body with a failing ``-->`` suffix rescans per start position —
# quadratic). An unterminated ``<!--`` is NOT matched: swallowing to
# end-of-text on a missing ``-->`` silently deletes visible prose. A tag
# body over the bound is not a real control tag and stays visible.
