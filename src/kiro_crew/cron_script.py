"""Code-based cron scripts — deterministic Python as cron callbacks.

Scripts under ``<config_dir>/crons/`` are LLM-writeable by design. The sandbox +
path-restriction prevents filesystem escape, but the LLM can register
self-written scripts. Mitigations: SEL audit trail on every invocation,
is_sensitive_path() blocks credential files, auto-pause after 5 consecutive
failures, concurrent execution guard prevents double-fire.

Usage:
    # <config_dir>/crons/my_monitor.py
    from kiro_crew.cron_script import Skip, Done

    def run(ctx):
        data = ctx.call_tool("kirocrew-core", "local_knowledge_search", {"query": "..."})
        if not ready(data):
            raise Skip()  # silent, retry next tick
        ctx.notify("Done: " + summary)
        raise Done()  # remove cron job

        #   * sanitize_spec_env() drops loader/interpreter-injection keys
        #     (LD_*, DYLD_*, and the specific PYTHONPATH/HOME/STARTUP/USERBASE
        #     startup channels -- see env._SPEC_ENV_DENIED_PREFIXES; it is a prefix
        #     set, NOT all of PYTHON*). Those are NOT in _CRON_ENV_DENY, and the spec
        #     env is externally authorable, so without this an `LD_PRELOAD` in a
        #     server's `env` block would be honoured by the dynamic loader inside
        #     the confinement wrapper process -- executing attacker code before
        #     the wrapper establishes containment. Pinning argv[0] does not help:
        #     the loader acts on the pinned binary. This is the same reason
        #     mcp_discovery routes its probe's spec env through the sanitizer;
        #     PATH is deliberately NOT denied, since forwarding it is the point.
        #   * sanitize_spec_env() ALSO drops the reserved KIROCREW_ namespace
        #     (env._SPEC_ENV_RESERVED_PREFIXES), which is an authorization control
        #     rather than a containment one and is the reason the two other filters
