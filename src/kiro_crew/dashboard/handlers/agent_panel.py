"""HTTP routes for a crew's webview.

Two halves with deliberately different auth, because they are different acts:

* **Publishing** (``/api/agent-panel/*``) is MCP-only and strict-internal. The
  crew a call writes to is derived from the CALLING SESSION's identity
  (``X-Session-Key``, vetted by ``_recognize_session``) and then from that
  session's agent -- never from the request body. So a crew can only ever
  publish its own webview, and raw HTTP with no recognized session identity is
  refused. Restricted (incognito/temporary/guest) sessions are refused too: a
  published panel is durable on-disk state, which is exactly what those modes
  promise not to leave behind.

  Both publish routes are listed in ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` --
  without that entry the internal-secret call falls through to cookie auth and
  every publish fails with 403.

* **Reading** (``/api/members/{slug}/panel``) is an ordinary cookie-authed
  dashboard route, because the drawer is what reads it. It is a read: nothing
  under it can publish or edit a panel.

    The crew comes from the session's own agent binding, never from the body: a
    body-supplied name would let one crew publish a webview that presents as
    another's, and the whole point of a per-crew panel is that the operator can
    trust whose state they are reading.

    AUTHORIZATION FIRST, and it cannot be left to the route listing. The crew is
    resolved from a caller-CHOSEN ``X-Session-Key``, so the header is an identity
    claim rather than a lookup key: a caller holding only a dashboard cookie could
    name any live session and have this resolve to THAT crew, then overwrite its

    Duplicating the data (it is also inside the document's island) is deliberate
    and bounded: ``publish`` caps it, and the alternative -- parsing it back out
