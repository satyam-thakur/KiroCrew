        """Respawn *info*'s run on a fresh task after an unexpected cancellation.

        Called from ``_run``'s CancelledError handler — the current task is
        being cancelled and cannot continue itself, so the continuation runs on
        a new task. One-shot: gated by ``info._cancel_retry_used`` at the call
        site. The original run's finally block still performs session cleanup
        (release/reset) but skips terminal finalization while ``_recovering``.

        **Cancellation-source contract.** This branch exists for cancellations
        that arrive from OUTSIDE the manager's own lifecycle — in practice the
        parent task tree being torn down around a live subagent (e.g. a
        dashboard slot reset/removal cancelling background tasks, or an event
        during gateway component re-init) — mirroring the main path's
        unexpected-cancel recovery. Every INTENTIONAL cancel site in
        this module sets a terminal marker before cancelling, and the recovery
        branch defers to all of them: ``cancel()`` sets ``user_stopped``,
        ``cancel_all()`` sets ``_shutting_down``, and ``_force_reap`` sets
        ``reaped`` (checked before the recovery branch). Any NEW code path that
        cancels a subagent task on purpose MUST set one of those markers first,
        or the cancel will be treated as unexpected and recovered once.

        Coordination is explicit, not timed: ``_resume`` awaits the ORIGINAL
        task object to fully complete (its finally does session release/reset,
        slot decrement, and pops the task registry) before respawning. This
        guarantees the old finally can neither pop the new task out of
        ``self._tasks`` nor emit a duplicate completion, and the respawn never
        starts against a session whose reset is still in flight. The respawn
        then re-acquires a slot by waiting for capacity (the old finally's
        ``_drain_queue`` may have admitted a queued spawn into the freed slot),
        so the concurrency ceiling is never exceeded.

        The pending ``_resume`` task itself is registered in ``self._tasks``
        (under ``"<id>:recovery"``) so ``cancel_all()`` reaches it during
        shutdown — a recovery can never outlive or escape manager teardown.

        its not-yet-started queue entries. Returns
        ``{"cancelled": [ids...], "unqueued": [ids...]}``.

        Backs the chip's "Stop all": a per-id cancel loop can only reach runs
        that are registered in ``_agents``, but a wave's members waiting behind
        the stagger / concurrency gate exist ONLY as ``_queue`` entries (the
        client sees just an aggregate count, no ids), so the queued remainder
        used to start and continue the batch after the user asked to stop it.

        Three deliberate exclusions:

        * **Approval-parked runs stay untouched.** A run parked on its spawn
          prompt (``_awaiting_approval`` with ``_exec_started`` still unset —
          the same pair ``terminal.py`` and the handlers'
          ``_awaiting_spawn_approval`` read) never executed anything and is
          blocked on the USER: the approval card is where they decide it, and
          cancelling underneath would resolve a question they are being asked.
        * **Other sessions' work is out of scope** — both in ``_agents`` and in
          the queue — so one chat's stop can never reach a sibling chat's wave.
        * **``_shutting_down`` is never set**: that is ``cancel_all_impl``'s
          shutdown path and would disable cancel-recovery manager-wide.

        The queue is drained FIRST: cancelling a running agent frees its slot
        and the freed slot's ``_drain_queue`` would otherwise admit a queued
        member of the very wave being stopped. Each drop routes through
        ``_unqueue`` so the depth re-emit AND the synthetic stopped-completion
        announce (see its docstring) stay on one path.

        Point-in-time semantics, stated plainly: a spawn submission still in
        flight when this runs (e.g. an ``api_spawn`` awaiting its pre-spawn
        warm step), or an entry ``_drain_queue`` has popped but not yet
        registered in ``_agents``, is invisible to both branches and can start
        afterwards. The stop covers the work that exists when it executes;
        the chip stays mounted for anything that lands later, so the user can
        stop again — the same property every existing cancel path
        (per-id and ``cancel_all``) has.
