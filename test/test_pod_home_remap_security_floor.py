"""Requirement (Connections G2 pod-grant-isolation): if ``HOME`` is remapped
for ANY process, the real passwd home's sensitive paths (``~/.aws``,
``~/.ssh``, ``~/.kirocrew*``) must STILL be denied by ``security.py``'s
matchers inside that process. A remap that unfences the real home is a
rejected design.

Why this matters for the pod ``HOME`` remap
(``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap``): ``security.py``'s sensitive-path
matchers run inside the GATEWAY process, evaluating a tool call's ARGUMENTS
against the gateway's own ``Path.home()`` -- the spawned kiro-cli child's
remapped ``HOME`` never reaches this code, because the gateway process's
``os.environ["HOME"]`` is never touched by ``build_pod_env`` or by
``_apply_pod_home_remap`` (which mutates only the CHILD's env dict handed to
``create_subprocess_exec``/``create_subprocess_limited``, not the gateway's
own ``os.environ``).

These tests pin that property directly: a fenced path resolved against the
gateway's OWN home stays denied regardless of what ``HOME`` a spawned
child happens to run under.
