/**
 * Crew Members — one durable, pinned DM thread per crew member.
 *
 * The page realizes the B+C merged design: a member list on the left, the
 * selected member's pinned DM thread in the center (the real chat stack,
 * hosted the way split-view panes host it), and a toggleable read-only
 * detail drawer on the right. Configuration WRITES are deliberately absent —
 * both Edit affordances navigate to the existing crew manager
 * (/capabilities?tab=crews), so this page never becomes a second editor.
 *
 * Identity is the exact CREW NAME, never the slug: slugification is lossy
 * (`Oncall` and `oncall` share a slug and therefore one thread directory),
 * so rows are keyed and selected by name, and a thread-open response whose
 * `member` is a DIFFERENT name is surfaced as a collision instead of being
 * silently mounted (first-bound-wins is the backend contract).
 *
 * The pin is a server-side property of member slots (born only through
 * POST /api/members/{slug}/thread). It is an invariant of every member
 * thread, so the UI does not announce it — there is no unpinned state to
 * contrast against.
 *
 * Which member is open rides the URL (`?member=<name>`), and the last one
 * opened is remembered per browser: a visit that names no member lands on
 * the remembered one (else the first row), never on the empty column.
