/**
 * REGRESSION GUARD — the idle older-prefetch cannot feed itself, and cannot move
 * a reader who is parked at the live end.
 *
 * Reported from a phone as "还是有自动 load previous 的问题，然后导致弹跳" — a page
 * of history landing on its own every few seconds, each landing displacing the
 * reader. Frame analysis of a 60fps recording measured one landing as a 108px
 * downward shift of the whole transcript: older rows prepend ABOVE, so a reader
 * sitting at `scrollTop === max` finds max has grown and is suddenly that far
 * from the bottom.
 *
 * Two independent defects made it self-sustaining:
 *
 * 1. NO POSITION GUARD. The walk poll refuses a bottom-followed reader in as many
 *    words ("its landings are pure disturbance budget"); the prefetch did not, so
 *    it was the one door left open to someone reading the live end.
 *
 * 2. AUTHORIZATION NEVER EXPIRED. `sawRealInputRef` is a one-way latch with a
 *    single write and no reset, so one touch of the transcript — which reading a
 *    long chat requires — unlocked the prefetch permanently. A landing's own
 *    compensation writes scrollTop, that write fires a `scroll` event, and the
 *    quiet timer counts it as activity: land → quiet → land, forever. The fix is
 *    a window refreshed only by `wheel`/`touchmove`, which our own writes never
 *    produce, so it ages out instead of latching.
 *
 * Source-scanned because the prefetch is an interval inside an effect with no
 * exported seam; the arithmetic relation in the third test is the part most
 * likely to be broken silently by a later constant tweak.
